# Electronic Paper Display driver for MSP432

This is a Code Composer project that drives a 2.7" ePaper display through the
MSP432 microcntoller and shows a sample image.

By the time I wrote this, the MSP432 microcontroller was not supported by Pervasive Display's
driver ![RePaper](https://www.repaper.org/). I don't know if that is still the case.
